# A Next.js-powered frontend for your Mirror blog

> This project mimics the [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz) publication design and pulls data from their APIs, allowing you to self-host your Mirror blog on a custom domain.

You can view a demo of this project by visiting [m1guelpf.blog](https://m1guelpf.blog), which hosts the [my Mirror publication](https://miguel.mirror.xyz).

## FAQ

**Is this decentralized?**

Kind of. While I'm pulling the article listing and contents from the Arweave chain directly, the publication and contributor details come from Mirror's APIs.

**Why did you make this?**

I like playing with stuff :). I really like Mirror's design, so I decided to create a [Ghost](https://ghost.org) theme "inspired" by their design. Once that was finished, I decided to turn that theme into something slightly more useful.

**Who are you?**

**I have another question**

Read [Building apps with Mirror](https://m1guelpf.blog/post/building-apps-with-mirror), an entry I wrote in my own Mirror publication explaining how this project works, and how you can build your own Mirror apps.
